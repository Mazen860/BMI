This project, "Exploring Body Mass Index: Unveiling Key Predictors and Sociodemographic Sensitivity," aimed to identify macroeconomic and societal factors influencing global BMI trends using country-level data. We applied multiple linear regression, including interaction and polynomial terms, to model the impact of variables such as GDP, Human Capital Index, Urbanization Rate, Population, Globalization Index, and Year on average BMI. After addressing multicollinearity and overfitting, our final model (Model 5) included a 4th-degree polynomial for the Human Capital Index, capturing its complex, nonlinear effect and achieving an adjusted R-squared of 57.85%. We found that economic growth, urbanization, and globalization are associated with higher BMI, while higher human capital tends to reduce it. These insights support targeted public health and economic strategies to address rising global obesity rates. All code, dataset, report, and presentation are included in this repository.
